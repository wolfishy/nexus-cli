## Nexus Network

[Nexus](https://nexus.xyz/) is a global distributed prover network that unites the world's computers to power a new and
better Internet: the Verifiable Internet.

There have been several testnets so far:

- Testnet 0: [October 8 â€“ 28, 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/nexus-launches-worlds-first-open-prover-network/)
- Testnet I: [December 9 â€“ 13, 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/the-new-nexus-testnet-is-live/)
- Testnet II: [February 18 â€“ 22, 2025](https://blog.nexus.xyz/testnet-ii-is-open/)
- Devnet: [February 22 - June 20, 2025](https://docs.nexus.xyz/layer-1/testnet/devnet)
- Testnet III: [Ongoing](https://blog.nexus.xyz/live-everywhere/)

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Precompiled Binary (Recommended)

For the simplest and most reliable installation:

```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```

This downloads the latest binary, prompts for Terms of Use acceptance, and starts interactive mode.

#### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated installations (e.g., in CI):

```bash
curl -sSf https://cli.nexus.xyz/ -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
NONINTERACTIVE=1 ./install.sh
```

### Proving

Proving with the CLI is documented [here](https://docs.nexus.xyz/layer-1/testnet/cli-node).

To start with an existing node ID, run:

```bash
nexus-cli start --node-id <your-node-id>
```

Alternatively, you can register your wallet address and create a node ID with the CLI, or at [app.nexus.xyz](https://app.nexus.xyz).

```bash
nexus-cli register-user --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
nexus-cli register-node --node-id <your-cli-node-id>
nexus-cli start
```

To run the CLI noninteractively, you can also opt to start it in headless mode.

```bash
nexus-cli start --headless
```

#### Quick Reference

The `register-user` and `register-node` commands will save your credentials to `~/.nexus/config.json`. To clear credentials, run:

```bash
nexus-cli logout
```

For troubleshooting or to see available command-line options, run:

```bash
nexus-cli --help
```

### Adaptive Task Difficulty

The Nexus CLI features an **adaptive difficulty system** that automatically adjusts task difficulty based on your node's performance. This ensures optimal resource utilization while preventing system overload.

#### How It Works

- **Starts at**: `small_medium` difficulty
- **Auto-promotes**: `small_medium` â†’ `medium` â†’ `large` â†’ `extra_large` â†’ `extra_large_2` (if tasks complete in < 7 minutes)
- **Safety**: `small` difficulty does not auto-promote (manual override only)

```
small_medium â†’ medium â†’ large â†’ extra_large â†’ extra_large_2
     â†‘           â†‘        â†‘         â†‘            â†‘
   Default    < 7 min   < 7 min   < 7 min     < 7 min
              success   success   success     success
```

#### When to Override Difficulty

**Lower Difficulty** (`Small` or `SmallMedium`):
- Resource-constrained systems
- Background processing alongside other apps
- Testing/development environments
- Battery-powered devices

**Higher Difficulty** (`Large`, `ExtraLarge`, or `ExtraLarge2`):
- High-performance hardware (8+ cores, 16+ GB RAM)
- Dedicated proving machines
- Experienced users who understand requirements
- Maximum reward optimization

#### Using Difficulty Override

```bash
# Lower difficulty for resource-constrained systems
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small_medium

# Higher difficulty for powerful hardware
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty medium
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty large
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_2
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_3
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_4
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_5

# Case-insensitive (all equivalent)
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty MEDIUM
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty medium
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty Medium
```

**Available Difficulty Levels:**
- `small` - Basic tasks, minimal resource usage
- `small_medium` - Default starting difficulty, balanced performance
- `medium` - Moderate complexity, good for most systems
- `large` - High complexity, requires powerful hardware
- `extra_large` - Very high complexity, for dedicated high-end systems
- `extra_large_2` - Maximum complexity, for the most powerful systems

#### Difficulty Guidelines

| Difficulty | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| `small` | Resource-constrained, background processing |
| `small_medium` | Default, balanced performance |
| `medium` | Standard desktop/laptop |
| `large` | High-performance systems |
| `extra_large` | Dedicated proving machines |
| `extra_large_2` | Maximum performance systems |

> **Tip**: Use `nexus-cli start --help` to see the full auto-promotion details in the CLI help text.

#### Monitoring Performance

Monitor performance in the dashboard:
- **Task Completion Time**: Shown in metrics panel
- **Promotion Status**: Whether system is promoting or maintaining level

#### Troubleshooting Difficulty Issues

**Tasks taking too long:**
```bash
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small_medium
```

**Want more challenging tasks:**
```bash
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty large
```

**Unsure about system capabilities:**
- Use the default adaptive system (no `--max-difficulty` needed)
- The system will automatically find the optimal difficulty for your hardware
- Only override if you're specifically unhappy with the automatic performance

### Docker Installation

For containerized deployments:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Update the node ID in `docker-compose.yaml`
3. Build and run:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs  # Check logs
docker compose down  # Shutdown
```

## Terms of Use

Use of the CLI is subject to the [Terms of Use](https://nexus.xyz/terms-of-use).
First-time users running interactively will be prompted to accept these terms.

---

## Node ID

During the CLI's startup, you'll be asked for your node ID. To skip prompts in a
non-interactive environment, manually create a `~/.nexus/config.json` in the
following format:

```json
{
   "node_id": "<YOUR NODE ID>"
}
```
